Cloud computing offers many advantages, including: 
Cost savings: You can pay for what you need and when you need it, and you can benefit from the buying power of large cloud providers. 
Scalability and flexibility: You can quickly spin up or retire instances, and you can scale computing resources. 
Faster time to market: You can deploy new instances quickly, which can accelerate development. 
Better collaboration: You can improve collaboration with cloud computing. 
Advanced security: Cloud storage providers implement baseline protections like authentication, access control, and encryption. 
Data loss prevention: Cloud computing can help prevent data loss. 
Higher performance and availability: Cloud computing resources are distributed across multiple cloud facilities, which can increase performance and availability. 
Improved productivity: Cloud computing can improve productivity. 
Lowered risk: Cloud computing can lower risk. 
More time to focus on business goals: You can spend less time on computer and data-storage issues and more time on business goals. 
Cloud computing can be used in a hybrid model with existing on-premises infrastructure, or it can replace it entirely.
