Are there any restrictions on using IP addresses within these subnets?
Yes. Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address, for a total of five IP addresses within each subnet.

For example, the IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:

192.168.1.0: Network address.
192.168.1.1: Reserved by Azure for the default gateway.
192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3: Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IP addresses to the virtual network space.
192.168.1.255: Network broadcast address.
